In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with type juggling and comparisons.  Consider this code:
```php
$value = "0";
if ($value) {  // This condition evaluates to false
    echo "Value is true";
} else {
    echo "Value is false";
}
```
This code snippet intends to check if the variable `$value` is considered "truthy." However, PHP's loose type comparison will cause the `if` condition to evaluate to false.  Even though `"0"` is a non-empty string, it is considered numerically equal to 0, and in a boolean context, 0 equates to false. This is due to PHP's loose typing and automatic type conversion.
