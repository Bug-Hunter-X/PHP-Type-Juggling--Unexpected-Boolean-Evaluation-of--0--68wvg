The solution is to use strict comparison (`===`) instead of loose comparison (`==`). Strict comparison checks for both value and type equality.  This prevents PHP from performing automatic type conversions that can lead to unexpected results.

```php
$value = "0";
if ($value === true) { // This condition will always be false
    echo "Value is strictly true";
} else {
    echo "Value is false or not strictly true"; // This will execute
}

// Better explicit check
if ($value === "0") { 
    echo "Value is the string '0'";
}

if ($value == 0) { // checks if numerical value is 0
    echo "Value is numerically 0";
}
```
By using strict comparison, we eliminate the ambiguity and ensure that the code behaves as expected.
